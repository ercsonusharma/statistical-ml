It is also a classification model which considers the feature are independent of each other.

If feature are dependent of each other i.e. it is correlated, then CRF - Conditional Random Field comes into picture.

Binary as well as multi-class classifier
P(C|X) = P(X|C)*P(C)/P(X)
P(C|X) :: Probability of classifying in class C given than the feature X is found.

Example: Predicting the game will be played or not on conditions like humidity,rain etc. Classifying into yes/no.
In case of other model like SVM, we tokenize and convert all the feature into some numeric form and then draw the hypeplane.

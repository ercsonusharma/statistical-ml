Loss(Cost) Function / Error: Function used to find the error at each step i.e. 
how much the predicted result is varying with the actual one. 
e.g. RMS, RAE, RSE, Cross Entropy - Binary, Categorical

Optimizer: Function used to decide the weight for the next step considering the loss function in order to reduce the error.
i.e. Goal- --> Minimize(Loss function)
e.g. SGD, RMSProp, AdaMax etc.

Learning Rate: The rate through which the optimizer is going to adjust the weight in order to achieve much loss in each step.
More learning rate is less time-consuming but will have impact on the training.


Activation Function.
